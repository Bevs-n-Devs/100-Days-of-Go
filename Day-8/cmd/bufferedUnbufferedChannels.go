/*
Unbuffered Channels (like the ones in the previous examples) block the sender until the receiver is ready,
and block the receiver until a value is available.
Buffered Channels allow sending values without waiting for a receiver as long as the buffer isnâ€™t full.

The channel can hold up to two values before blocking.
The values can be sent to the channel without needing an immediate receiver.
