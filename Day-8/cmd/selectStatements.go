The select statement allows a Goroutine to wait on multiple communication
operations (channels). Itâ€™s like a switch statement but for channels.

The select statement waits for messages from both ch1 and ch2 channels.
Whichever channel sends a message first will be handled, and the other case will be ignored.
This is useful for handling multiple asynchronous operations concurrently.
