/*
Interfaces provide a way to write flexible and decoupled code.
You donâ€™t need to know what specific type you are dealing with; you only need to know that it satisfies the interface.

For example, you might have different types that "speak" in different ways (a Person, a Dog, a Robot),
but as long as they all implement the Speak method, you can use them interchangeably through the Speaker interface.

With polymorphism you can use interfaces to work with different types that share the same behavior.
